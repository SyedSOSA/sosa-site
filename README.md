# SOSA Next.js Project (skeleton)

This is a starter skeleton for the full SOSA Next.js project you requested.
It includes folders, placeholder pages, sample data (jobs, testimonials, blogs),
and instructions to run locally and extend the project.

## Quick start

1. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

2. Run dev server
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open http://localhost:3000

## What is included (skeleton)
- pages/
  - index.js (Home)
  - about.js
  - services/index.js
  - services/resume-writing.js
  - recruiters.js
  - business-setup.js
  - marketplace.js
  - testimonials.js
  - blogs.js
  - contact.js
  - login.js
  - api/post-job.js (serverless placeholder to email job posts)
- public/images/ (placeholders)
- data/jobs.json (sample jobs)
- data/testimonials.json
- data/blogs.json

You can replace placeholders with real images and content. This skeleton is intentionally minimal so you can iterate quickly. 

If you want the full fleshed-out project (complete pages, styles, optimized images), I can expand these files next.
